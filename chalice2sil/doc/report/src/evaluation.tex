\subsection{Chalice2SIL+Silicon versus Sy-whatever}
\begin{sketch}
Compare Chalice2SIL+Silicon performance with Syxc (?) both in terms of execution speed and capabilities
\end{sketch}

\subsection{SIL as a translation target/verification intermediate language}
\begin{sketch}
\begin{itemize}
\item Term/Expression distinction (technical)
\item P-expressions/terms versus non-P-expressions/terms (technical)
\item control flow (need for a while loop construct)
\item Some way of capturing state (more general old expression, "transaction"-like scopes)
\end{itemize}
\end{sketch}
