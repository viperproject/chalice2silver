\subsection{Silicon}\label{sct:silicon}
Silicon is an automated program verifier for SIL programs based on symbolic execution. 
It was derived from Syxc \cite{schwerhoff2011symbolic}, an alternative verifier for Chalice, and adapted to verify SIL instead.
As Silicon is currently the only verifier for SIL, we use it to test Chalice2SIL.
